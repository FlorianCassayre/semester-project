abstract="Set theory is the common language of mathematics. Therefore, set theory plays an important r{\^o}le in many important applications of automated deduction. In this paper, we present an improved tableau calculus for the decidable fragment of set theory called multi-level syllogistic with singleton (MLSS). Furthermore, we describe an extension of our calculus for the bigger fragment consisting of MLSS enriched with free (uninterpreted) function symbols (MLSSF).",
